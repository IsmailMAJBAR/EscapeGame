# EscapeGame
A simple escape game where you are in a room and you need to get out, basic mechanics like grab are implemented.
This is a very simple game used to train on Unreal Engine v4.13.
This repo contains only the build game for mac, because I made it on a mac, for code source I can't upload it due to loss of my mac :(.
